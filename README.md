# LLM/Developer Handoff Context

## Project Overview
- **What it is:** A Python-based political board game, now with a Flask backend and a mobile-friendly web frontend.
- **Goal:** Make the game playable on iPhone (and other devices) via a web browser.
- **All blue gradient bars have been removed for a cleaner, more information-dense interface.**
- **The UI is now more compact, with full-width identity cards and neutral backgrounds for all status bars.**

## Current State
- **Backend:** Flask API (`server.py`) exposes game logic and serves static files.
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JS in `static/` folder, mobile-optimized, interacts with backend via REST API.
- **Game Logic:** All core logic is in Python (`engine/`, `models/`, etc.), reused from the CLI version.
- **Deployment:** Local server works on custom port (e.g., 5001). Deployment instructions are in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Recent Issues & Next Steps
- **Legislation Voting Fix:** Fixed critical backend bug where players couldn't vote on their own legislation, causing the game to get stuck. Backend now properly resets player index after voting completes.
- **Frontend Voting UI:** Added "Pass Turn" button when players have no valid voting options during legislation sessions.
- **Sponsor Support Enhancement:** **NEW** - Players who sponsor legislation can now commit additional PC to their own legislation throughout the rounds, providing more strategic control and agency.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test suite covers all major game mechanics. Manual testing is possible via browser.
- **API URL:** In `static/script.js`, `API_BASE_URL` is set to `http://localhost:5001/api` (matches backend port).

## Key Files
- `server.py`: Flask app, API endpoints, static file serving.
- `static/index.html`, `static/style.css`, `static/script.js`: Frontend.
- `engine/`, `models/`, `game_data.py`: Game logic and data.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Deployment instructions for Render, Netlify, Heroku, Railway, and local testing.

## Immediate To-Dos
- **Test sponsor support enhancement:** Verify sponsors can support their own legislation with additional PC commitment.
- **Test API endpoints:** Use Postman/curl or browser to verify `/api/game`, `/api/game/<id>`, etc.
- **Test frontend:** Play through a game in browser, check for bugs, and improve UX.
- **Automated tests:** (Optional) Add unit tests for API and game logic.

## How to Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
PORT=5001 python3 server.py
# Visit http://localhost:5001 in your browser
```

## How to Deploy
See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for step-by-step instructions for Render, Netlify, etc.

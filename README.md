# Election Game

A digital adaptation of a political strategy board game, featuring AI opponents and comprehensive simulation capabilities.

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- **Robust Game Engine**: Complete implementation of all game mechanics
- **AI Opponents**: Multiple AI personas (Random, Economic, Legislative, Balanced, Heuristic)
- **Smart AI Behavior**: AI opponents aware of game effects (e.g., avoid Fundraise during stock market crash)
- **Multiple AI Support**: Play against 1-3 AI opponents with different personas
- **CLI Interface**: Text-based human vs AI gameplay with detailed turn logging
- **Minimal Web Interface**: Simplified web UI for human vs AI games
- **Simulation Framework**: Comprehensive testing with 300+ games per experiment
- **Skill vs Luck Analysis**: Quantified game balance (similar to Texas Hold 'Em)
- **Web Deployment**: Functional web interface with backend API

### ðŸ”„ Current Development Phase
We are transitioning to a **Player-First Refactor** to focus on gameplay experience and human vs AI gameplay.

## Quick Start

### For Players
1. **CLI Game**: Run `python3 cli_game.py multi` for 1 vs 3 AI opponents
2. **Web Interface**: Visit `http://localhost:5001/play` for minimal interface
3. **Full Web Game**: Visit `http://localhost:5001/` for complete interface
4. Experience the strategic depth of political campaigning

### CLI Game Usage
```bash
# Play against 3 AI opponents with different personas
python3 cli_game.py multi

# Play against 1 AI opponent
python3 cli_game.py single heuristic

# Available AI personas: random, economic, legislative, balanced, heuristic
python3 cli_game.py single economic

# Features:
# - AI opponents aware of game effects (e.g., avoid Fundraise during stock market crash)
# - Detailed turn logging showing all AI actions
# - Pause between AI turns for better game flow
# - Human player can view their hidden mandate
```

### For Developers
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the web server: `python server.py`
4. Test CLI game: `python cli_game.py multi`
5. Run the simulation framework: `python simulation_runner.py`

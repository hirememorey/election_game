# LLM/Developer Handoff Context

## Project Overview
- **What it is:** A Python-based political board game, now with a Flask backend and a mobile-friendly web frontend.
- **Goal:** Make the game playable on iPhone (and other devices) via a web browser.
- **All blue gradient bars have been removed for a cleaner, more information-dense interface.**
- **The UI is now more compact, with full-width identity cards and neutral backgrounds for all status bars.**

## Current State
- **Backend:** Flask API (`server.py`) exposes game logic and serves static files.
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JS in `static/` folder, mobile-optimized, interacts with backend via REST API.
- **Game Logic:** All core logic is in Python (`engine/`, `models/`, etc.), reused from the CLI version.
- **Deployment:** Local server works on custom port (e.g., 5001). Deployment instructions are in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- **ü§´ Secret Commitment System:** **COMPLETED** - Replaced gambling-style legislation with strategic secret commitments
- **üß™ Automated Testing:** **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive Playwright tests validate game playability

## Recent Issues & Next Steps
- **Secret Commitment System:** **COMPLETED** - Players now make secret commitments to support/oppose legislation, revealed dramatically at term end
- **Automated Frontend Testing:** **COMPLETED** - Playwright tests ensure game never gets stuck and all features work correctly
- **Legislation Voting Fix:** Fixed critical backend bug where players couldn't vote on their own legislation, causing the game to get stuck. Backend now properly resets player index after voting completes.
- **Frontend Voting UI:** Added "Pass Turn" button when players have no valid voting options during legislation sessions.
- **Sponsor Support Enhancement:** **NEW** - Players who sponsor legislation can now commit additional PC to their own legislation throughout the rounds, providing more strategic control and agency.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test suite covers all major game mechanics. Manual testing is possible via browser.
- **API URL:** In `static/script.js`, `API_BASE_URL` is set to `http://localhost:5001/api` (matches backend port).

## Key Files
- `server.py`: Flask app, API endpoints, static file serving.
- `static/index.html`, `static/style.css`, `static/script.js`: Frontend.
- `engine/`, `models/`, `game_data.py`: Game logic and data.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Deployment instructions for Render, Netlify, Heroku, Railway, and local testing.
- `tests/election-game.spec.ts`: **NEW** - Comprehensive Playwright tests for frontend validation

## Immediate To-Dos
- **‚úÖ Secret Commitment System:** Fully implemented and tested
- **‚úÖ Automated Testing:** Playwright tests validate all game flows
- **Test sponsor support enhancement:** Verify sponsors can support their own legislation with additional PC commitment.
- **Test API endpoints:** Use Postman/curl or browser to verify `/api/game`, `/api/game/<id>`, etc.
- **Test frontend:** Play through a game in browser, check for bugs, and improve UX.

## How to Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
PORT=5001 python3 server.py

### ü§´ Secret Commitment System (New Core Mechanic)
The previous "Gambling-Style" legislation system has been **successfully replaced** with a more strategic and interactive **Secret Commitment System**. This elevates the game from a resource management puzzle to a high-stakes game of political poker.

**Key Features:**
- **Secret Contributions**: Players no longer commit PC publicly. All contributions to support or oppose legislation are made secretly.
- **Bluffing & Betrayal**: Publicly promise support while secretly opposing a bill, or bluff about the amount of your contribution to force other players to spend their resources.
- **Dramatic Reveals**: At the end of a term, all secret contributions are revealed simultaneously, leading to dramatic moments of truth.
- **Strategic Depth**: Success now depends on your ability to read your opponents and manage their trust, not just on the size of your treasury.
- **Implementation**: Backend stores secret commitments separately, frontend provides clear confirmation messages to acting players while other players see generic notifications.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Backend**: `SECRET_COMMITMENTS` storage in `server.py`, updated action processing and legislation resolution
- **Frontend**: Enhanced UI with secret commitment notices and confirmation messages
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage validates all secret commitment scenarios

### üé≠ Identity System
Players have unique identities that affect gameplay:

**Political Archetypes:**
- **The Insider**: Starts with State Senator office and 15 PC
- **The Populist**: Gains +1 PC when gaining PC from negative Public Mood as an Outsider
- **The Fundraiser**: First Fundraise action each term grants +2 PC
- **The Orator**: Once per term, may re-roll one failed legislation die roll

**Personal Mandates (Missions):**
- **The Principled Leader**: Win Presidency without ever holding Governor office
- **The Environmentalist**: Ensure Infrastructure Bill passes twice, personally sponsor one
- **The War Hawk**: Ensure Military Funding bill passes with Critical Success
- **The Kingmaker**: Be allied with the player who wins Presidency
- **The Master Legislator**: Personally sponsor and pass 3 different types of legislation
- **The Statesman**: Hold Governor or US Senator office at game end
- **The Shadow Donor**: Ensure a player you supported wins Presidency
- **The Unpopular Hero**: Pass Healthcare Overhaul legislation
- **The Minimalist**: Win Presidency having committed 20 PC or less to final election
- **The People's Champion**: Ensure Public Mood is +2 or +3 at final Presidential election
- **The Opportunist**: Win Presidency without ever being an Incumbent before final Election Phase

**Access Methods:**
- **Swipe up** on mobile devices
- **Click "Game Info"** button in header
- **Press G key** on desktop
- **"View Identity"** button during action phase

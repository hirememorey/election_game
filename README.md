# LLM/Developer Handoff Context

## Project Overview
- **What it is:** A Python-based political board game, now with a Flask backend and a mobile-friendly web frontend.
- **Goal:** Make the game playable on iPhone (and other devices) via a web browser.

## Current State
- **Backend:** Flask API (`server.py`) exposes game logic and serves static files.
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JS in `static/` folder, mobile-optimized, interacts with backend via REST API.
- **Game Logic:** All core logic is in Python (`engine/`, `models/`, etc.), reused from the CLI version.
- **Deployment:** Local server works on custom port (e.g., 5001). Deployment instructions are in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Recent Issues & Next Steps
- **Static files 404:** When accessing `/`, the server returns 404 for `/script.js` and `/style.css`. Likely cause: Flask static file serving config.
- **Testing:** No automated tests for API or frontend yet. Manual testing is possible via browser.
- **API URL:** In `static/script.js`, `API_BASE_URL` is set to `http://localhost:5000/api` (should match backend port and deployment URL).

## Key Files
- `server.py`: Flask app, API endpoints, static file serving.
- `static/index.html`, `static/style.css`, `static/script.js`: Frontend.
- `engine/`, `models/`, `game_data.py`: Game logic and data.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Deployment instructions for Render, Netlify, Heroku, Railway, and local testing.

## Immediate To-Dos
- **Fix static file serving:** Ensure `/script.js` and `/style.css` are served correctly (Flask's `static_folder` config or explicit routes).
- **Test API endpoints:** Use Postman/curl or browser to verify `/api/game`, `/api/game/<id>`, etc.
- **Test frontend:** Play through a game in browser, check for bugs, and improve UX.
- **Automated tests:** (Optional) Add unit tests for API and game logic.

## How to Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
PORT=5001 python3 server.py
# Visit http://localhost:5001 in your browser
```

## How to Deploy
See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for step-by-step instructions for Render, Netlify, etc.

- **Use Favor** (0 AP): Strategic advantage actions with selection menu
- **Support/Oppose Legislation** (1 AP): Interactive legislation system with custom PC commitment
- **Campaign** (2 AP): Place influence for future elections
- **Trading** (0 AP): Propose trades of PC/favors for votes during legislation sessions

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd election
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start server (port 5001 to avoid macOS AirPlay conflicts)
./start_server.sh
# or manually
PORT=5001 python3 server.py

# Access at http://localhost:5001
```

4. **Resolution**: Actions resolve, game state updates
5. **Repeat**: Until election victory conditions met

## üö® Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **In-memory Storage**: Game state lost on server restart (production needs database)
- **Single Session**: No persistent user accounts or game history
- **No AI Opponents**: All players must be human
- **Apple-Level Design**: Fully implemented and ready for user experience testing

### Recent Bug Fixes
- **Use Favor Action**: Fixed to work with selection menu
- **PC Commitment**: Added custom PC amounts for legislation and candidacy
- **Automatic Event Phases**: Events now draw automatically
- **Term Transitions**: Fixed state cleanup between terms
- **Legislation Timing**: Fixed premature legislation resolution
- **Static File Serving**: Fixed 404 errors for CSS/JS files
- **Round 5 Confusion**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Legislation session now triggers at end of round 4
- **Action Point Handling**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Clear UI and Pass Turn functionality added

## üéØ Next Steps

### High Priority

2. **Extensive Playtesting**: Test Action Points and trading systems thoroughly
3. **Balance Adjustments**: Fine-tune AP costs and PC commitment amounts
4. **Legislation Session Testing**: Test the improved legislation session flow (no more round 5 confusion)

### Medium Priority
1. **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory storage with persistent database
2. **Multiplayer Real-time**: Add WebSocket support for live multiplayer
3. **Advanced AI**: Add AI opponents with strategic decision-making
4. **Network Action Design**: Implement merged Network/Alliance system

### üîÑ Current Development Phase
We are transitioning to a **CLI-First Development** approach to focus on gameplay experience and rapid iteration.

## Quick Start

### For Players
1. **CLI Game**: Run `python3 cli_game.py multi` for 1 vs 3 AI opponents
2. **Single AI**: Run `python3 cli_game.py single heuristic` for 1 vs 1 gameplay
3. Experience the strategic depth of political campaigning

### CLI Game Usage
```bash
# Play against 3 AI opponents with different personas
python3 cli_game.py multi

# Play against 1 AI opponent
python3 cli_game.py single heuristic

# Available AI personas: random, economic, legislative, balanced, heuristic
python3 cli_game.py single economic

# Features:
# - AI opponents aware of game effects (e.g., avoid Fundraise during stock market crash)
# - Detailed turn logging showing all AI actions
# - Pause between AI turns for better game flow
# - Human player can view their hidden mandate
```

### For Developers
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Test CLI game: `python3 cli_game.py multi`
4. Run the simulation framework: `python3 simulation_runner.py`

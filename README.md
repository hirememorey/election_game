# Election Game

A digital adaptation of a political strategy board game, featuring AI opponents and comprehensive simulation capabilities.

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- **Robust Game Engine**: Complete implementation of all game mechanics
- **AI Opponents**: Multiple AI personas (Random, Economic, Legislative, Balanced, Heuristic)
- **Simulation Framework**: Comprehensive testing with 300+ games per experiment
- **Skill vs Luck Analysis**: Quantified game balance (similar to Texas Hold 'Em)
- **Web Deployment**: Functional web interface with backend API

### ðŸ”„ Current Development Phase
We are transitioning to a **Player-First Refactor** to focus on gameplay experience and human vs AI gameplay.

## Quick Start

## Getting Started for New Developers

### 1. Understand the Vision
Read the following documents:
- `PLAYER_FIRST_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` - Detailed implementation roadmap
- `DEVELOPER_HANDOFF_V2.md` - Current state and next steps
- `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Task tracking and success criteria

### 2. Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd election

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

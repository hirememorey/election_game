# Simulation Framework

The Election Game now includes a comprehensive simulation framework for game balance analysis and automated testing.

## Overview

The simulation framework allows for headless execution of games without the web interface, enabling:
- **Automated Testing**: Run thousands of games quickly
- **Balance Analysis**: Compare different strategies and game mechanics
- **Agent Development**: Create and test AI players with different strategies
- **Tournament Systems**: Run competitions between different agent types

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run a single simulation with random agents
python simulation_harness.py

# Run comprehensive tests
python test_simulation_framework.py
```

### Expected Output

```
Testing Simulation Harness...
Starting simulation with 4 players: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana']

--- Round 1 ---
Current player: Alice
Phase: ACTION_PHASE
Action Points: {0: 2, 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2}
Alice chose: ActionFundraise
...

--- Simulation Complete ---
Winner: Alice
Rounds: 44, Terms: 3
Final Scores: {...}
Simulation Time: 0.002s
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### `SimulationHarness`
The main simulation engine that:
- Manages game state without web interface
- Handles all phase transitions automatically
- Provides clean API for agent integration
- Tracks comprehensive game metrics

#### `GameEngine` (Enhanced)
The engine now serves as the single source of truth for:
- **Valid Action Determination**: Only the engine determines what actions are available
- **Action Point Validation**: Properly checks costs including dynamic modifiers
- **Resource Requirements**: Validates PC, favors, and other resource constraints
- **Timing Rules**: Enforces proper timing restrictions (e.g., candidacy in round 4)

#### `Agent` Base Class
A new abstract base class that:
- Provides consistent interface for all agents
- Ensures deterministic behavior
- Simplifies agent development
- Supports both simple and complex agent strategies

### Game Flow

1. **Initialization**: Create game state with specified players
2. **Action Phase**: Agents choose actions based on available AP
3. **Legislation Phase**: Auto-resolve pending legislation
4. **Election Phase**: Auto-resolve elections and determine winners
5. **Term Transition**: Start new term or end game after 3 terms
6. **Scoring**: Calculate final influence and determine winner

## Agent Interface

### Creating Custom Agents

Agents must implement the following interface:

```python
class CustomAgent(Agent):
    def choose_action(self, state: GameState, valid_actions: List[Action]) -> Action:
        """
        Choose an action for the given player in the current game state.
        
        Args:
            state: Current game state
            valid_actions: List of valid actions from the engine
            
        Returns:
            Action: The chosen action to take
        """
        # Your agent logic here
        return chosen_action
```

### Available Actions

- `ActionFundraise`: Gain Political Capital
- `ActionNetwork`: Build connections
- `ActionSponsorLegislation`: Create legislation
- `ActionSupportLegislation`: Support pending legislation
- `ActionOpposeLegislation`: Oppose pending legislation
- `ActionDeclareCandidacy`: Run for office (round 4 only)
- `ActionUseFavor`: Use political favors
- `ActionPassTurn`: Skip turn

### State Information

The `GameState` object provides access to:
- `state.players`: List of all players
- `state.action_points`: Current AP for each player
- `state.current_phase`: Current game phase
- `state.term_legislation`: Pending legislation for voting
- `state.pending_legislation`: Currently active legislation
- `state.public_mood`: Current public mood (-3 to +3)
- `state.round_marker`: Current round number

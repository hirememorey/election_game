Test Mobile Improvements for Election Game

This test verifies that:
1. Swipe gestures are disabled on mobile devices (width <= 600px)
2. Identity information is accessible via dedicated buttons
3. Quick access panel doesn't interfere with action visibility on mobile
4. Modal-based identity display works on mobile

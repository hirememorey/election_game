## üîç **CURRENT STATUS: Frontend-Backend Synchronization Issue (July 15, 2025)**

### **Issue Summary**
Playwright tests are failing due to a frontend-backend synchronization issue. The backend is working correctly (turn advancement functioning), but the frontend UI is not updating the phase indicator to show the correct current player.

### **Technical Investigation Results**
- **Backend**: ‚úÖ Turn advancement working correctly (player 0 ‚Üí player 1 ‚Üí player 2)
- **API Communication**: ‚úÖ Frontend receiving correct game state via `getGameState()`
- **Function Calls**: ‚úÖ `updatePhaseDisplay()` function being called
- **DOM Update**: ‚ùå `#phase-indicator .player-name` element not updating

### **Test Failure**
```
Error: Timed out 10000ms waiting for expect(locator).toBeVisible()
Locator: locator('#phase-indicator .player-name').getByText('Bob')
Expected: visible
Received: <element(s) not found>
```

### **Debug Logs Added**
- Added debug logs to `getGameState()` to track current player index and name
- Added debug logs to `updatePhaseDisplay()` to track DOM update attempts
- Force `getGameState()` call after every action to ensure state synchronization

### **Next Steps for Resolution**
1. **Investigate DOM Selector**: Verify `#phase-indicator .player-name` selector is correct
2. **Check DOM Timing**: Ensure DOM is ready when update is called
3. **Add More Debugging**: Add console logs to see exact DOM manipulation
4. **Test DOM Update**: Manually test the DOM update mechanism

### **Files to Investigate**
- `static/script.js` - `updatePhaseDisplay()` function
- `static/index.html` - Phase indicator DOM structure
- `tests/test_simple_flow.spec.ts` - Test that's failing

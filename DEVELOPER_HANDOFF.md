## 🚨 Current Limitations

### High Priority
- **Frontend Implementation**: Action Points system UI needs completion (see `FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`)
- **In-memory Storage**: Game state lost on server restart (production needs database)

### Medium Priority
- **No AI Opponents**: All players must be human
- **Single Session**: No persistent user accounts or game history
- **Limited Analytics**: No game statistics or performance tracking

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Complete Action Points Frontend** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**What**: Implement the Action Points system UI in the frontend
**Why**: Backend is complete and tested, frontend is the only missing piece
**How**: Follow `FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions
**Files to Modify**: `static/script.js`, `static/style.css`
**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours
**Success Criteria**: 
- Players can see their remaining Action Points
- Action buttons show AP costs and are disabled when insufficient
- Campaign action works with office selection and PC input
- Turn status is clear and updates correctly

### 2. **Extensive Playtesting** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**What**: Test the Action Points system and trading systems thoroughly
**Why**: Ensure new mechanics enhance rather than detract from gameplay
**How**: Play multiple games with different strategies
**Focus Areas**:
- Action Points balance (are costs appropriate?)
- Trading mechanic balance (is negotiation engaging?)
- PC commitment amounts (are they strategic?)
- Incumbent/outsider public mood effects (is the tension engaging?)
- Overall game flow and pacing

### 3. **Balance Adjustments** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**What**: Fine-tune AP costs and PC commitment amounts based on playtesting
**Why**: Ensure optimal gameplay experience
**How**: Adjust values in `engine/engine.py` and `engine/resolvers.py`
**Areas to Monitor**:
- AP costs for different actions
- PC commitment amounts for legislation
- Trading negotiation dynamics
- Campaign influence effectiveness
- Public mood effect magnitudes

### 4. **Database Integration** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**What**: Replace in-memory storage with persistent database
**Why**: Production readiness and game state persistence
**How**: Add PostgreSQL/MongoDB integration
**Files to Modify**: `server.py`, add database models
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

### 5. **Network Action Design** (LOW PRIORITY)
**What**: Implement merged Network/Alliance system from `NETWORK_ACTION_DESIGN.md`
**Why**: Add strategic depth if Form Alliance is missed
**How**: Follow design document specifications
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

## 🚀 Development Setup

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd election
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start server (port 5001 to avoid macOS AirPlay conflicts)
./start_server.sh
# or manually
PORT=5001 python3 server.py

# Access at http://localhost:5001
```

### Production Deployment
- **URL**: https://election-game.onrender.com
- **Configuration**: `render.yaml` for automatic deployment
- **Dynamic URLs**: Frontend automatically detects development vs production
- **Cache Busting**: Version parameters force browser cache updates

### Development Environment Notes
- **Port Conflicts**: macOS AirPlay uses port 5000, so we use 5001
- **Dependencies**: Minimal - just Flask and flask-cors
- **Python Version**: Tested with Python 3.8+
- **Browser Testing**: Chrome/Firefox recommended

## 📚 Key Documentation

### Essential Reading
- **`LLM_HANDOFF_CONTEXT.md`**: Comprehensive project context and recent changes
- **`FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`**: Action Points system frontend implementation
- **`GAME_IMPROVEMENTS.md`**: Recent feature additions and improvements
- **`NETWORK_ACTION_DESIGN.md`**: Design for merging Network and Form Alliance actions

### Code Organization Patterns
- **Actions**: Add new actions in `engine/actions.py`, implement resolution in `engine/resolvers.py`
- **Game State**: Modify `models/game_state.py` for new state properties
- **Frontend**: Update `static/script.js` for UI logic, `static/style.css` for styling
- **API**: Add endpoints in `server.py`
- **Testing**: Create test files following existing patterns

## 🎮 Game Balance Considerations

### Current Balance
- Political Capital (PC) is the primary resource
- Actions have clear costs and benefits
- Random events add unpredictability
- Favor system adds strategic depth
- PC commitment system adds strategic depth
- Trading mechanic adds negotiation
- Action Points system adds player autonomy
- **NEW**: Incumbent/outsider public mood logic creates strategic tension

### Potential Balance Issues to Watch
- PC commitment amounts may need tuning based on playtesting
- Trading mechanic may need balance adjustments
- Random events could be too swingy
- Player interaction could be enhanced
- Missing Form Alliance reduces strategic options
- **NEW**: Public mood effect magnitudes may need adjustment based on playtesting

## 🔧 Technical Patterns to Follow

### Action System
- All game actions inherit from base `Action` class
- Actions are processed through `engine.process_action()`
- Resolution logic in `resolvers.py` maintains consistency
- Follow the pattern in `test_form_alliance_removal.py` for adding/removing actions

### State Management
- Game state is immutable (new state created for each action)
- Clear serialization for API communication
- State includes all necessary game information
- Term transitions properly clean up state

### Frontend-Backend Communication
- REST API with JSON payloads
- Frontend polls for state updates
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- PC commitment uses prompt dialogs for user input
- Dynamic API URL detection for development vs production

### Mobile Responsiveness
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Responsive typography and spacing
- Favor selection menu is mobile-friendly

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Technical
- Response times under 50ms
- Zero 404 errors for static files
- All API endpoints working correctly
- Mobile compatibility across devices
- All tests passing

### Gameplay
- Engaging strategic depth
- Balanced action choices
- Clear player feedback
- Smooth game flow
- Successful negotiation and deal-making during legislation sessions
- Strategic PC commitment decisions
- Smooth automatic event phases
- Multiple actions per turn with Action Points
- **NEW**: Engaging incumbent/outsider tension through public mood effects

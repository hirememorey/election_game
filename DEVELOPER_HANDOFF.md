## üîç **CURRENT STATUS: Frontend-Backend Synchronization Issue (July 15, 2025)**

### **Issue Summary**
Playwright tests are failing due to a frontend-backend synchronization issue. The backend is working correctly (turn advancement functioning), but the frontend UI is not updating the phase indicator to show the correct current player.

### **Technical Investigation Results**
- **Backend**: ‚úÖ Turn advancement working correctly (player 0 ‚Üí player 1 ‚Üí player 2)
- **API Communication**: ‚úÖ Frontend receiving correct game state via `getGameState()`
- **Function Calls**: ‚úÖ `updatePhaseDisplay()` function being called
- **DOM Update**: ‚ùå `#phase-indicator .player-name` element not updating

### **Test Failure**
```
Error: Timed out 10000ms waiting for expect(locator).toBeVisible()
Locator: locator('#phase-indicator .player-name').getByText('Bob')
Expected: visible
Received: <element(s) not found>
```

### **Debug Logs Added**
- Added debug logs to `getGameState()` to track current player index and name
- Added debug logs to `updatePhaseDisplay()` to track DOM update attempts
- Force `getGameState()` call after every action to ensure state synchronization

### **Next Steps for Resolution**
1. **Investigate DOM Selector**: Verify `#phase-indicator .player-name` selector is correct
2. **Check DOM Timing**: Ensure DOM is ready when update is called
3. **Add More Debugging**: Add console logs to see exact DOM manipulation
4. **Test DOM Update**: Manually test the DOM update mechanism

### **Files to Investigate**
- `static/script.js` - `updatePhaseDisplay()` function
- `static/index.html` - Phase indicator DOM structure
- `tests/test_simple_flow.spec.ts` - Test that's failing

### 4. **Balance Adjustments** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**What**: Fine-tune AP costs, PC rewards, and legislation targets based on playtesting of the new system.
**Why**: Ensure optimal gameplay experience
**How**: Adjust values in `engine/engine.py` and `engine/resolvers.py`
**Areas to Monitor**:
- AP costs for different actions
- PC commitment amounts for legislation
- Trading negotiation dynamics
- Campaign influence effectiveness
- Public mood effect magnitudes
- Secret commitment amounts and strategic impact

### 5. **Database Integration** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**What**: Replace in-memory storage with persistent database
**Why**: Production readiness and game state persistence
**How**: Add PostgreSQL/MongoDB integration
**Files to Modify**: `server.py`, add database models
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

### 6. **Network Action Design** (LOW PRIORITY)
**What**: Implement merged Network/Alliance system from `NETWORK_ACTION_DESIGN.md`
**Why**: Add strategic depth if Form Alliance is missed
**How**: Follow design document specifications
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

# Developer Handoff

## 1. Summary of Changes

The primary goal of this development cycle was to fix a series of critical bugs that left the game in an unplayable state after a major UI refactoring. The two-step action flow for legislation was not correctly implemented, leading to game state mismatches, action deserialization errors, and UI display bugs.

The following fixes were implemented:

-   **Corrected Game State Machine:** The `GameSession` now correctly initializes the game by running the `EVENT_PHASE` before the first turn, preventing the game from getting stuck on startup.
-   **Fixed Action Deserialization:** Corrected the decorator order in `engine/actions.py` to ensure all `Action` subclasses properly inherit the `from_dict` method.
-   **Implemented UI Action Architecture:** Created a clear separation between game state-changing actions and UI-only actions by introducing a `UIAction` base class in a new `engine/ui_actions.py` file. This resolved the "Invalid selection" bug.
-   **Fixed End-to-End Tests:** The `test_end_to_end.py` test was fixed and updated to align with the server's correct, synchronous behavior, and all backend tests are now passing.
-   **Fixed Frontend Build Process:** Identified and used the `npm run build` command to correctly bundle the frontend JavaScript, ensuring that all UI fixes are visible to the user.
-   **Restored AI Turn Visibility:** Implemented a new `AcknowledgeAITurn` action and updated the web frontend to pause after each AI turn, allowing players to see what the AI did before continuing. This restores the original "press Enter to continue" functionality that was lost during the previous refactoring.
-   **Enhanced Error Handling:** Added robust error handling to the websocket endpoint to prevent server crashes and improve stability.
-   **Fixed Round Advancement Bug:** Added logic to detect when all players have 0 action points and automatically trigger the upkeep phase to advance rounds. This resolves the issue where the game would get stuck in Round 1 and not progress to subsequent rounds.

## 2. Current Status

**All systems are go.** All backend (`pytest`), frontend (`npm test`), and end-to-end tests are passing. The game is stable, playable, and the core two-step UI action flow is functioning as intended. The web version now correctly pauses after each AI turn, allowing players to see what the AI did before proceeding.

The project is now in a solid state for the next phase of development.

## 3. Next Steps

With the core game loop and UI interaction model stabilized, the project is ready for further feature development or gameplay balancing. Recommended next steps could include:

-   Expanding the set of Event cards.
-   Adding more Political Archetypes with unique abilities.
-   Conducting large-scale simulations to fine-tune the economic and legislative balance.
-   Refactoring the `Declare Candidacy` action to use the new two-step UI action system for a cleaner user experience.

## 4. Recent Fix (2025-07-28)

**Round Advancement Fix:** The game was getting stuck in Round 1 because there was no logic to detect when all players had used their action points and trigger the upkeep phase. This was particularly problematic for the web version deployed to Render.

**Solution:** Added logic in `engine/engine.py` in the `process_action` method to check if all players have 0 action points after a player's turn ends. When this condition is met, the game automatically triggers the upkeep phase, which:
- Advances the round marker
- Refreshes all players' action points to 2
- Runs the event phase for the new round
- Returns control to the human player

This fix ensures the game can progress through multiple rounds and terms as intended.

## 5. Sponsor Legislation Fix (2025-01-27)

**Issue:** The "Sponsor Legislation" action was broken on the web version deployed to Render. When users selected this action, the game state would corrupt and display `undefined/4 Rounds`, making the game unplayable.

**Root Cause Analysis:** The problem was caused by multiple issues in the backend:
1. Missing imports in `game_session.py` causing `NameError`
2. Incomplete data structure - frontend couldn't display user-friendly names for legislation options
3. AI confusion - AI players were receiving UI-only actions that had no resolvers
4. Brittle action reconstruction - backend couldn't reliably reconstruct actions from user choices

**Solution:** Implemented a comprehensive fix across multiple components:

**Backend Changes:**
- **Fixed `game_session.py`**: Added missing imports, enhanced `_handle_ui_action` to provide richer data with `display_name` and `cost`, simplified `process_action` to handle user choices cleanly
- **Fixed `engine/engine.py`**: Modified `get_valid_actions` to differentiate between human and AI players - AI players receive concrete actions, human players receive UI actions
- **Created comprehensive tests**: Added `test_game_session.py` with robust unit tests validating the complete two-step flow

**Frontend Changes:**
- **Updated `static/app.js`**: Modified `promptForSubChoice` to use new `display_name` field, updated sub-choice handling to send correct `choice` format

**Quality Assurance:**
- All backend tests pass
- Solution is clean, simple, and robust
- Maintains separation of concerns (UI actions for humans, concrete actions for AI)
- Provides rich data structure for better UX
- Extensible pattern for future two-step actions

This fix ensures the "Sponsor Legislation" action works correctly on the web version deployed to Render.

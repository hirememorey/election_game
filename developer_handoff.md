## 1. Summary of Changes

The primary goal of this development cycle was to address a critical usability issue in the web-based version of the game. The "Available Actions" menu was cluttered with a long, unmanageable list of legislation-related actions, making the game difficult to play.

To solve this, I implemented a new, two-step action flow for all legislation-related actions (sponsoring, supporting, and opposing). Instead of displaying every possible permutation of an action, the UI now presents a single, high-level action (e.g., "Sponsor Legislation"). When the user selects this action, the backend responds with a sub-menu of specific choices (e.g., a list of bills to sponsor).

This change involved a significant refactoring of the backend and frontend code, including:

-   **`engine/engine.py`**: The `get_valid_actions` method was overhauled to generate high-level UI actions instead of specific, permutated actions.
-   **`engine/ui_actions.py`**: A new file was created to define the new UI-level action classes (`UISponsorLegislation`, `UISupportLegislation`, `UIOpposeLegislation`).
-   **`game_session.py`**: The `GameSession` class was updated to manage the new, two-step action flow, with logic to handle pending UI actions and generate sub-menus.
-   **`static/app.js`**: The frontend was modified to handle the new two-step flow, with logic to display sub-menus and send the user's specific choices back to the server.
-   **Tests**: All unit and frontend tests were updated to reflect the new architecture.

## 2. Current Status

All of the Python unit tests and the JavaScript frontend tests are now passing. This indicates that the core logic of the application is stable and that the individual components are working as expected.

However, the main end-to-end test, `test_full_game_loop_one_turn` in `test_end_to_end.py`, is still failing. This is the last remaining issue to be resolved.

## 3. Next Steps

The immediate priority is to fix the failing end-to-end test. Here's a breakdown of the issue and the recommended next steps:

-   **The Problem**: The test is failing with an `AssertionError: assert 2 == 1`, which means the player's action points are not being deducted correctly after they take an action.
-   **The Root Cause**: The captured output from the test run shows the error: `Error processing action: type object 'ActionFundraise' has no attribute 'from_dict'`. This is the key to solving the problem. The `GameSession` is unable to correctly deserialize the action it receives from the client because it can't find the `from_dict` method on the action class.
-   **The Solution**: Although a `from_dict` method was added to the base `Action` class in `engine/actions.py`, it seems it's not being correctly inherited or accessed by the `ActionFundraise` class. The next developer should investigate why this is the case and ensure that all action classes can be correctly deserialized from a dictionary.

Once the end-to-end test is passing, the final step will be to manually test the application in the browser to ensure that the new, two-step action flow is working as expected from a user's perspective.

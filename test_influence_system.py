# --- First Principles & Red Teaming ---
# 1. Legislation should pass if net influence >= success_target
# 2. Critical success if net influence >= crit_target
# 3. Failure if net influence < success_target
# 4. Supporters are rewarded if bill passes
# 5. Sponsor is penalized if bill fails
# 6. War penalty reduces net influence
# 7. Edge: Negative net influence, zero support, only opposition, etc.

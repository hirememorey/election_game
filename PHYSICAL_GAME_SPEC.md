## Section 1: Game Overview (The "Elevator Pitch")

**Concept:** *Election* is a competitive political strategy game for 2-4 players. Players take on the roles of ambitious political operators, vying for power by managing resources, sponsoring and defeating legislation, forming fragile alliances, and ultimately, running for the nation's highest offices.

**Core Fantasy:** Players should feel like cunning political masterminds. Every decision is a calculated risk, every promise is a potential weapon, and every dollar of Political Capital is a tool for influence. The heart of the game is the **Secret Commitment** system, where players secretly fund or fight legislation, leading to dramatic reveals, shocking betrayals, and nail-biting victories.

**Objective:** To be the player with the most **Influence** at the end of the final term. Influence is gained by holding political office and by achieving a secret **Personal Mandate**. The player with the most Influence at the end of the game wins.

    *   The Round Track (1-4)
    *   4 Office Slots (State Senator, Governor, US Senator, President) with space for Player Pawns.

*   **Dimensions:** 8" x 4" (20.3cm x 10.2cm).
*   **Purpose:** A designated space behind the player screen for organizing a player's neutral PC chips. This clearly separates their available funds from committed funds.

**4. Political Capital (PC) Chips (240 total)**

*   **Breakdown (per player color - 60 chips):**
    *   25x "1 PC" Chips (e.g., Solid Red)
    *   20x "5 PC" Chips (e.g., Solid Red)

## Section 3: Game Setup

1.  **Place the Game Board** in the center of the playing area.
2.  **Place Markers:** Put the Round Marker on "Round 1" and the Public Mood Marker on the "0" space.
3.  **Create Decks:** Shuffle the Event, Legislation, and Political Favor decks separately and place them face down on their designated spaces on the board.
4.  **Each Player Chooses a Color** and takes the following components:
    *   One Player Screen.
    *   One Player Treasury Mat (place behind the screen).
    *   All PC Chips of their color (place on their Treasury Mat).
    *   Two "Support" and two "Oppose" Commitment Chips (place on their Treasury Mat).
    *   Two Action Point (AP) tokens.
5.  **Deal Identities:** Shuffle the Political Archetype cards and deal one face-up to each player. Shuffle the Personal Mandate cards and deal one face-down to each player. This is their secret objective.
6.  **Starting Bonuses:** Players gain any starting PC or offices indicated on their Archetype card. Place the corresponding Player Pawn and Office Pawn in the office space.
7.  **Determine First Player:** The player who most recently voted in a real-life election takes the First Player Token. Play will proceed clockwise.
8.  **The Chamber:** Keep the Chamber Bags in a general supply area. They will be brought onto the board as legislation is sponsored.

## Section 4: The Chamber: Setup and Protocol

*This section details the most crucial mechanic and must be understood by all players.*

The Chamber Bag is the heart of the game's political intrigue. It is used to facilitate the secret commitment of PC to legislation.

**The Golden Rules of The Chamber:**
1.  **One Bag Per Bill:** When a bill is sponsored, a dedicated Chamber Bag is placed on its Legislation Card. All commitments for that bill go into its specific bag.
2.  **Secrecy is Paramount:** When a player commits funds, they must do so out of sight of all other players. The player to their left should hold the bag open for them, shielding it from view.
3.  **Commitments are Final:** Once chips are in the bag, they cannot be removed until the official reveal.
4.  **Commitment Chips are a Limited Resource:** You only have 2 "Support" and 2 "Oppose" chips per term. Once used, they remain in the bag until the Legislation Phase. Spend them wisely.

**How to Use The Chamber:**
1.  **Declare Intent:** A player uses the "Support/Oppose Legislation" action. They publicly state *which bill* they are targeting (e.g., "I am taking a stance on the Infrastructure Bill").
2.  **Assemble the Commitment:** Behind their screen, the player gathers two things from their Treasury Mat:
    *   The amount of their **colored PC Chips** they wish to commit.
    *   **One** of their colored **Commitment Chips** ("Support" or "Oppose").
3.  **The Secret Drop:** The player cups their assembled chips in their hand and drops the entire handful into the correct Chamber Bag for that bill.

**The Reveal:** At the end of the term, during the Legislation Phase, the First Player will dramatically upend the bag for a specific bill, spilling all committed chips into the center of the board for tallying.

## Section 5: Gameplay & Detailed Actions

A game is played over a series of Terms. Each Term consists of 4 Rounds. Each Round, starting with the First Player, players take turns until everyone has used all their Action Points.

**On Your Turn:**
You begin your turn with 2 Action Points (AP). You may spend these AP to perform one or more actions. Your turn ends when you have 0 AP or choose to Pass.

**Available Actions:**
*   **Fundraise (Cost: 1 AP):** Gain 5 PC from the bank. Place these chips on your Treasury Mat.
*   **Network (Cost: 1 AP):** Gain 2 PC from the bank and draw 1 Political Favor card.
*   **Sponsor Legislation (Cost: 2 AP):** Choose one of the top two face-up bills from the Legislation deck. Pay its sponsorship cost in PC. Place the bill face-up on the board and place an empty Chamber Bag on the card.
*   **Support/Oppose Legislation (Cost: 1 AP):** The core secret action. Follow the protocol in Section 4 to secretly commit PC and a Commitment Chip to a bill currently on the floor.
*   **Declare Candidacy (Cost: 2 AP):** In Round 4 only, place your Player Pawn on one of the empty Office tracks to declare you are running for that office.
*   **Use Favor (Cost: 1 AP):** Play a Political Favor card from your hand and resolve its effect.
*   **Pass (Cost: 0 AP):** End your turn, forfeiting any remaining AP.

After all players have finished their turns, the Round Marker advances. After Round 4, the Term ends and you proceed to the Legislation Phase.

## Section 6: End of Term Phases

**1. Legislation Phase:**
For each bill on the board, one by one, the First Player reveals the contents of its Chamber Bag.
1.  **Tally Votes:** Separate the chips by color and Commitment Chip type ("Support" or "Oppose"). Announce each player's total commitment (e.g., "Sarah supported with 12 PC, Michael opposed with 8 PC").
2.  **Determine Outcome:** Calculate the Net Influence (Total Support PC - Total Opposition PC). Compare this to the bill's Success and Critical Success targets to see if it passed.
3.  **Resolve Effects:** Apply rewards/penalties to the bill's sponsor, changes to Public Mood, and rewards to any players who supported a successful bill, based on their individual contribution.
4.  **Clean Up:** Return all PC and Commitment chips from the bag to the respective players' Treasuries. The bill is resolved. Move to the next bill.

**2. Election Phase:**
After all legislation is resolved, elections are held for any office with at least one candidate. This is resolved with a simple influence system. Winners place their pawns in the office spaces.

**3. New Term:**
The First Player token passes to the left. The Round Marker returns to 1. All players receive 2 AP, and a new term begins.

## Section 7: Manufacturing & Design Intent Notes

*   **Chip Weight & Material:** The choice of 11.5g clay composite chips is intentional. The tactile feel of heavy, satisfying chips is a key part of the premium player experience. It makes spending "Political Capital" feel weighty and significant.
*   **Limited Commitment Chips:** Limiting players to 2 Support/2 Oppose actions per term is the core of the strategic tension. It prevents players from influencing every bill and forces them to make difficult choices about where to apply their political will. This scarcity creates value and drives player interaction.
*   **Treasury Mat:** The separate mat is a crucial usability feature. It prevents players from confusing their available funds with chips they might have set aside for a future commitment, reducing errors and keeping the game state clear.
*   **The Chamber Bag:** The single bag is a piece of theatre. The act of concealing the drop, the sound of hidden chips, and the final, dramatic reveal are central to the game's emotional arc. It creates a focal point of tension and excitement.

# LLM Handoff Context: Political Board Game Project

## üéØ Project Overview

**What this is:** A Python-based political strategy board game with a Flask backend and mobile-friendly web frontend. Players compete in elections through strategic actions, resource management, and political maneuvering.

**Current State:** Fully functional game with rich mechanics and a completely redesigned strategic web interface. **All major bugs have been fixed and new features are fully tested.** **The UI has been overhauled to a three-zone layout for strategic clarity.**

**Architecture:** Clean separation between game logic (Python) and presentation (HTML/CSS/JS), with REST API communication.

## üìù Recent Gameplay/Codebase Changes (Latest Updates)

### Strategic Three-Zone UI Overhaul (LATEST - Just Completed)
- **Complete UI Redesign**: Implemented a new three-zone layout to enhance strategic decision-making. The vintage poster aesthetic has been streamlined to prioritize clarity.
  - **Zone 1: Player Dashboard (Footer)**: A persistent bottom bar showing the current player's critical stats: Name, Archetype, Mandate, PC, AP (as a meter), and a list of held Favors.
  - **Zone 2: Main Stage (Center)**: The primary interactive area. It displays available actions, event cards, and contextual UI for legislation and trading. It also contains the scrollable Game Log.
  - **Zone 3: Intelligence Briefing (Header)**: A top bar containing a global Game Status Ticker (Round, Phase, Mood) and compact summary cards for all opponents, showing their public PC, favor count, and held offices.
  - **Impact**: Provides players with all necessary information at a glance, separating personal status, global context, and available actions to reduce cognitive load and improve strategic planning.
  - **Status**: Fully implemented and tested with a new smoke test (`test_new_ui_layout.py`).

- **Removed Complex Styling**: The previous "Vintage Political Poster" and "Apple-level" design systems have been replaced with a cleaner, more direct grid-based layout that is more maintainable.

- **JS Refactoring**: The `script.js` file was completely refactored. The monolithic `updateGameDisplay()` function was replaced with modular functions for each zone: `renderPlayerDashboard()`, `renderMainStage()`, and `renderIntelligenceBriefing()`.

### Round 5 Confusion Fix (Previously)
- **Fixed Round Logic**: Legislation session now triggers at the END of round 4, not beginning of round 5.
  - **Files Modified**: `engine/engine.py`

### Recent Critical Bug Fixes (Previously)
- **Trading Action Visibility Fix**: Fixed critical bug where trading actions weren't showing during legislation sessions.
- **Multiple Legislation Sponsorship Fix**: Fixed a bug that prevented players from sponsoring more than one piece of legislation per term.

### Major Gameplay Mechanics Overhaul (Previous)
- **Incumbent/Outsider Public Mood Logic**: Completely redesigned public mood effects to create strategic tension.

  - `server.py`: Removed API endpoint handling
  - `static/script.js`: Removed from frontend action buttons
  - `cli.py`: Removed from CLI menu and help text
- **Testing**: `test_form_alliance_removal.py` verifies the action is gone and other actions still work
- **Impact**: Players now have a simpler action set: Fundraise, Network, Sponsor Legislation, Declare Candidacy, Use Favor, Support/Oppose Legislation, Trading, Campaign

### Previous Major Fixes
- **Legislation Session Timing:**  
  Legislation is now only resolved at the end of the term, during a dedicated legislation session phase. All sponsored bills are queued in `term_legislation` and resolved together after all players have had a chance to vote. Legislation is not resolved after each round. The frontend and backend are both confirmed to follow this logic.
  - `pending_legislation` is only for the current round, and is moved to `term_legislation` at upkeep.
  - See `test_legislation_timing.py` for a test that verifies this flow.

- **Support/Oppose Legislation Restrictions:**  
  Support and oppose legislation actions are now restricted to only the legislation session phase (end of term). Players cannot support or oppose legislation during rounds 1-3. This prevents premature legislation resolution and ensures all players have a chance to vote on bills during the dedicated session.

- **Frontend/Backend Sync:**  
  The UI and backend are now fully aligned on the legislation session mechanic. The frontend only displays voting options for unresolved legislation during the session, not after each round. Between rounds, queued legislation is not shown unless in the session.

   ```python
   @dataclass
   class ActionNewAction(Action):
       # Add any parameters needed
       pass
   ```

2. **Implement Resolver** in `engine/resolvers.py`:
   ```python
   def resolve_new_action(state: GameState, action: ActionNewAction) -> GameState:
       # Implement game logic
       return state
   ```

3. **Register in Engine** in `engine/engine.py`:
   ```python
   self.action_resolvers = {
       # ... existing actions
       "ActionNewAction": resolvers.resolve_new_action,
   }
   ```

4. **Add API Endpoint** in `server.py`:
   ```python
   elif action_type == 'new_action':
       action = ActionNewAction(player_id=player_id)
   ```

5. **Add Frontend Button** in `static/script.js`:
   ```javascript
   { type: 'new_action', label: 'New Action', description: 'Description' }
   ```

6. **Test**: Create a test file following existing patterns

### Deployment
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Detailed deployment instructions

- Resolution logic in `resolvers.py` maintains consistency
- Follow the pattern in `test_form_alliance_removal.py` for adding/removing actions

### State Management
- Game state is immutable (new state created for each action)
- Clear serialization for API communication
- State includes all necessary game information
- Term transitions properly clean up state

### Frontend-Backend Communication
- REST API with JSON payloads
- Frontend polls for state updates
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- PC commitment uses prompt dialogs for user input

### Mobile Responsiveness

## üéÆ Game Balance Considerations

### Current Balance
- Political Capital (PC) is the primary resource
- Actions have clear costs and benefits
- Random events add unpredictability
- Favor system adds strategic depth
- **PC commitment system adds strategic depth**
- **Trading mechanic adds negotiation**
- **Action Points system adds player autonomy**
- **Simplified action set** (no Form Alliance) may need balance adjustments

### Potential Balance Issues
- PC commitment amounts may need tuning based on playtesting
- Trading mechanic may need balance adjustments
- Random events could be too swingy
- Player interaction could be enhanced
- **Missing Form Alliance** reduces strategic options - consider Network Action Design

## üé® Frontend Implementation Requirements: Three-Zone Layout

### Overview
The frontend has been **completely refactored** to a three-zone layout. The previous implementation guides are now obsolete. The new system is simpler and more modular.

### How It Works

The `updateUi()` function in `static/script.js` is the new main rendering entry point. It calls three helper functions, one for each zone:

1.  **`renderIntelligenceBriefing()`**:
    *   Populates the top bar.
    *   Renders the `game-status-ticker` with the current round, phase, and public mood.
    *   Renders a summary card for each opponent in the `intelligence-briefing` div, showing their name, PC, favor count, and office.

2.  **`renderMainStage()`**:
    *   Populates the central content area.
    *   Renders the available action buttons in the `action-list` div based on the current game phase.
    *   Renders the game history into the `game-log` div.
    *   (This function will also be responsible for showing contextual UI like Event Cards or Trading menus in the future).

3.  **`renderPlayerDashboard()`**:
    *   Populates the sticky footer.
    *   Displays the current player's name, archetype, mandate, PC, and favors.
    *   Renders the visual AP meter (`#ap-meter`) showing spent and remaining Action Points.

### Files to Modify for UI Changes
- **`static/script.js`**: Modify the `render...` functions to change what's displayed.
- **`static/style.css`**: Modify the CSS to change the appearance and layout.
- **`static/index.html`**: Only modify this if you need to change the fundamental three-zone structure.

### Success Criteria
- Players can clearly see their own stats, opponent stats, and available actions in their dedicated zones.
- The UI is responsive and functional on mobile.
- The core game loop remains fast and bug-free.

## üéØ Immediate Development Priorities

1. **UI Polish**: The new layout is a functional wireframe. The top priority is to apply high-quality styling, transitions, and responsive design improvements to make it visually appealing.
2. **Extensive Playtesting**: Test the game flow and balance with the new, clearer UI.
3. **Balance Adjustments**: Fine-tune AP costs and PC commitment amounts based on playtesting.
4. **Consider Network Action Design**: If Form Alliance is missed, implement the merged Network/Alliance system from `NETWORK_ACTION_DESIGN.md`
5. **Database Integration**: For production readiness
6. **Enhanced Testing**: More comprehensive unit tests for edge cases
7. **UI Polish**: Better visual feedback and animations

## [2024-07-07] Negative Favors System
- The Political Favors system now includes negative favors, which can impose temporary or strategic disadvantages on players.
- The backend tracks and resolves all negative favor effects, including debts, public gaffes, media scrutiny, compromising positions, and hot potato.
- The frontend visually distinguishes negative favors and provides special UI for player choices and targeting.
- See GAME_IMPROVEMENTS.md for rationale and details.

#### Media Scrutiny Favor Logic Fix (2024-07-07)
- Media Scrutiny now halves only the base 5 PC from Fundraise actions. Bonuses (archetype, allies) are added after halving. This matches the intended design and ensures consistent, fair application of the effect.

### [2024-07-08] Bug Fix: Skip Trading Button in Legislation Session
- Fixed a frontend bug where clicking "Skip Trading" during the legislation session did nothing and logged `Unknown action type: complete_trading` in the console. The frontend now correctly triggers the `complete_trading` action, allowing the game to proceed to the voting phase as intended.

**The project is in excellent shape with a solid foundation, clear architecture, and comprehensive improvements. The UI has been completely overhauled for strategic clarity and maintainability. The next LLM has a strong, simplified base to build upon. The most immediate opportunity is to add high-quality styling and animations to the new functional UI layout.**

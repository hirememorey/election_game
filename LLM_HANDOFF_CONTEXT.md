  - `engine/actions.py`: Removed `ActionFormAlliance` class
  - `engine/resolvers.py`: Removed `resolve_form_alliance()` function and imports
  - `engine/engine.py`: Removed from action resolvers mapping
  - `server.py`: Removed API endpoint handling
  - `static/script.js`: Removed from frontend action buttons
  - `cli.py`: Removed from CLI menu and help text
- **Testing**: `test_form_alliance_removal.py` verifies the action is gone and other actions still work
- **Impact**: Players now have a simpler action set: Fundraise, Network, Sponsor Legislation, Declare Candidacy, Use Favor, Support/Oppose Legislation, Trading, Campaign

### Previous Major Fixes
- **Legislation Session Timing:**  
  Legislation is now only resolved at the end of the term, during a dedicated legislation session phase. All sponsored bills are queued in `term_legislation` and resolved together after all players have had a chance to vote. Legislation is not resolved after each round. The frontend and backend are both confirmed to follow this logic.
  - `pending_legislation` is only for the current round, and is moved to `term_legislation` at upkeep.
  - See `test_legislation_timing.py` for a test that verifies this flow.

- **Support/Oppose Legislation Restrictions:**  
  Support and oppose legislation actions are now restricted to only the legislation session phase (end of term). Players cannot support or oppose legislation during rounds 1-3. This prevents premature legislation resolution and ensures all players have a chance to vote on bills during the dedicated session.

- **Frontend/Backend Sync:**  
  The UI and backend are now fully aligned on the legislation session mechanic. The frontend only displays voting options for unresolved legislation during the session, not after each round. Between rounds, queued legislation is not shown unless in the session.

3. **Action Phase**: Players take turns performing actions using Action Points
4. **Resolution**: Actions resolve, game state updates
5. **Repeat**: Until election victory conditions met

### Current Available Actions
- **Fundraise** (1 AP): Gain Political Capital (PC) - 5 PC base, +2 for Fundraiser archetype, +10 with Hedge Fund Bro ally
- **Network** (1 AP): Gain 2 PC + 1-2 political favors
- **Sponsor Legislation** (2 AP): Create legislation for votes/mood (cost varies by legislation type)
- **Declare Candidacy** (2 AP): Run for office (Round 4 only, cost varies by office + optional PC commitment)
- **Use Favor** (0 AP): Strategic advantage actions (requires having political favors, now with selection menu)
- **Support/Oppose Legislation** (1 AP): Interactive legislation system with custom PC commitment (restricted to legislation session only)
- **Campaign** (2 AP): Place influence for future office elections (NEW)
- **Trading** (0 AP): Propose trades of PC/favors for votes during legislation sessions

### Recent Major Improvements
1. **Action Points System**: Players get 3 AP per turn with variable costs for different actions
2. **Political Favors System**: Players can now use favors gained from networking with proper UI
3. **Trading Mechanic**: Players can negotiate deals during legislation sessions for votes
4. **Candidacy Timing**: Only one candidacy per round, prevents clutter
5. **Legislation Support/Opposition**: Players can support/oppose others' legislation with custom PC amounts
6. **Automatic Event Phases**: Smooth game flow with automatic event card drawing
7. **PC Commitment System**: Strategic depth through custom PC investment in actions

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd election
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start server (note: port 5000 may be in use by macOS AirPlay)
./start_server.sh
# or manually specify port
PORT=5001 python3 server.py

# Access at http://localhost:5001
```

### Development Environment Notes
- **Port Conflicts**: macOS AirPlay Receiver uses port 5000 by default. Use port 5001 or disable AirPlay in System Preferences
- **Dependencies**: Minimal - just Flask and flask-cors (see requirements.txt)
- **Python Version**: Tested with Python 3.8+
- **Browser Testing**: Chrome/Firefox recommended for development

### Testing Strategy
- **Run all tests**: `python3 test_*.py` to verify everything works
- **Individual tests**: Each test file focuses on specific functionality
- **Manual testing**: Use the web interface for UI testing
- **Performance testing**: `performance_test.py` for response time verification

### Code Organization Patterns
- **Actions**: Add new actions in `engine/actions.py`, implement resolution in `engine/resolvers.py`
- **Game State**: Modify `models/game_state.py` for new state properties
- **Frontend**: Update `static/script.js` for UI logic, `static/style.css` for styling
- **API**: Add endpoints in `server.py`
- **Testing**: Create test files following existing patterns (see test_*.py files)

### Adding New Actions (Step-by-Step)
1. **Define Action Class** in `engine/actions.py`:
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class ActionNewAction(Action):
       # Add any parameters needed
       pass
   ```

2. **Implement Resolver** in `engine/resolvers.py`:
   ```python
   def resolve_new_action(state: GameState, action: ActionNewAction) -> GameState:
       # Implement game logic
       return state
   ```

3. **Register in Engine** in `engine/engine.py`:
   ```python
   self.action_resolvers = {
       # ... existing actions
       "ActionNewAction": resolvers.resolve_new_action,
   }
   ```

4. **Add API Endpoint** in `server.py`:
   ```python
   elif action_type == 'new_action':
       action = ActionNewAction(player_id=player_id)
   ```

5. **Add Frontend Button** in `static/script.js`:
   ```javascript
   { type: 'new_action', label: 'New Action', description: 'Description' }
   ```

6. **Test**: Create a test file following existing patterns

### Deployment

- Actions are processed through `engine.process_action()`
- Resolution logic in `resolvers.py` maintains consistency
- Follow the pattern in `test_form_alliance_removal.py` for adding/removing actions

### State Management
- Game state is immutable (new state created for each action)
- Clear serialization for API communication
- State includes all necessary game information
- Term transitions properly clean up state

### Frontend-Backend Communication
- REST API with JSON payloads
- Frontend polls for state updates
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- PC commitment uses prompt dialogs for user input

### Mobile Responsiveness
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Responsive typography and spacing
- Favor selection menu is mobile-friendly

## üéÆ Game Balance Considerations

### Current Balance
- Political Capital (PC) is the primary resource
- Actions have clear costs and benefits
- Random events add unpredictability
- Favor system adds strategic depth
- **PC commitment system adds strategic depth**
- **Trading mechanic adds negotiation**
- **Action Points system adds player autonomy**
- **Simplified action set** (no Form Alliance) may need balance adjustments

### Potential Balance Issues
- PC commitment amounts may need tuning based on playtesting
- Trading mechanic may need balance adjustments
- Random events could be too swingy
- Player interaction could be enhanced
- **Missing Form Alliance** reduces strategic options - consider Network Action Design

## üîÑ Re-enabling Form Alliance (If Needed)

If you want to re-enable the Form Alliance action:

1. **Restore Action Class** in `engine/actions.py`:
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class ActionFormAlliance(Action):
       pass
   ```

2. **Restore Resolver** in `engine/resolvers.py`:
   ```python
   def resolve_form_alliance(state: GameState, action: ActionFormAlliance) -> GameState:
       # Copy from git history or NETWORK_ACTION_DESIGN.md
   ```

3. **Update Imports** in all affected files
4. **Restore Frontend Button** in `static/script.js`
5. **Restore CLI Option** in `cli.py`
6. **Test**: Run `test_form_alliance_removal.py` to verify restoration

## üé® Frontend Implementation Requirements: Action Points System

### Overview
The Action Points system has been fully implemented in the backend but **requires frontend implementation**. This is a high-priority task that will complete Phase 2 of the game refinements.

### What Needs to Be Implemented

#### 1. Action Points Display
**Location**: `static/script.js` - `updateActionButtons()` function
**Requirements**:
- Show remaining Action Points for current player
- Display AP costs for each action button
- Disable actions when insufficient AP
- Clear visual indication of whose turn it is

**Implementation Pattern**:
```javascript
// Add to updateActionButtons()
const currentPlayer = gameState.players[gameState.current_player_index];
const remainingAP = gameState.action_points[currentPlayer.id] || 3;

// Show AP display
const apDisplay = document.createElement('div');
apDisplay.className = 'action-points-display';
apDisplay.innerHTML = `
    <strong>${currentPlayer.name}'s Turn</strong><br>
    Action Points: ${remainingAP}/3
`;
actionList.appendChild(apDisplay);

// Update action buttons with AP costs
const actions = [
    { type: 'fundraise', label: 'Fundraise', ap_cost: 1, description: 'Gain Political Capital' },
    { type: 'network', label: 'Network', ap_cost: 1, description: 'Gain PC and favors' },
    { type: 'sponsor_legislation', label: 'Sponsor Legislation', ap_cost: 2, description: 'Create legislation' },
    { type: 'campaign', label: 'Campaign', ap_cost: 2, description: 'Place influence for future election' },
    // ... other actions
];

// Disable actions when insufficient AP
const canAfford = remainingAP >= action.ap_cost;
button.disabled = !canAfford;
```

#### 2. Campaign Action UI
**Location**: `static/script.js` - Add new action button and handler
**Requirements**:
- Office selection dropdown (STATE_SENATOR, CONGRESS_SEAT, GOVERNOR, US_SENATOR, PRESIDENT)
- PC amount input field
- Validation (must have enough PC)
- Clear success/error feedback

**Implementation Pattern**:
```javascript
// Add to actions array
{ type: 'campaign', label: 'Campaign', ap_cost: 2, description: 'Place influence for future election' }

// Add campaign handler
function handleCampaignAction() {
    const officeSelect = document.getElementById('campaign-office');
    const pcInput = document.getElementById('campaign-pc');
    
    const officeId = officeSelect.value;
    const influenceAmount = parseInt(pcInput.value);
    
    if (!officeId || !influenceAmount || influenceAmount <= 0) {
        alert('Please select an office and enter a valid PC amount');
        return;
    }
    
    // Call API
    performAction('campaign', {
        office_id: officeId,
        influence_amount: influenceAmount
    });
}

// Add campaign modal/dialog
function showCampaignDialog() {
    const modal = document.createElement('div');
    modal.className = 'campaign-modal';
    modal.innerHTML = `
        <h3>Campaign for Office</h3>
        <select id="campaign-office">
            <option value="">Select Office...</option>
            <option value="STATE_SENATOR">State Senator</option>
            <option value="CONGRESS_SEAT">Congress Seat</option>
            <option value="GOVERNOR">Governor</option>
            <option value="US_SENATOR">US Senator</option>
            <option value="PRESIDENT">President</option>
        </select>
        <input type="number" id="campaign-pc" placeholder="PC to commit" min="1">
        <button onclick="handleCampaignAction()">Campaign</button>
        <button onclick="closeModal()">Cancel</button>
    `;
    document.body.appendChild(modal);
}
```

#### 3. Turn Status Display
**Location**: `static/script.js` - `updateGameState()` function
**Requirements**:
- Clear indication of current player
- Remaining AP display
- Turn phase information
- Visual feedback for turn transitions

**Implementation Pattern**:
```javascript
// Add to updateGameState()
const turnStatus = document.getElementById('turn-status');
const currentPlayer = gameState.players[gameState.current_player_index];
const remainingAP = gameState.action_points[currentPlayer.id] || 3;

turnStatus.innerHTML = `
    <div class="turn-info">
        <strong>Current Turn:</strong> ${currentPlayer.name}<br>
        <strong>Action Points:</strong> ${remainingAP}/3<br>
        <strong>Phase:</strong> ${gameState.current_phase}
    </div>
`;
```

#### 4. CSS Styling
**Location**: `static/style.css`
**Requirements**:
- Action points display styling
- Campaign modal styling
- Disabled action button styling
- Turn status styling
- Mobile responsive design

**Implementation Pattern**:
```css
.action-points-display {
    background: #f0f0f0;
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 10px 0;
    border-radius: 5px;
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: bold;
}

.campaign-modal {
    position: fixed;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    background: white;
    padding: 20px;
    border: 2px solid #333;
    border-radius: 10px;
    z-index: 1000;
}

.action-button:disabled {
    opacity: 0.5;
    cursor: not-allowed;
}

.turn-info {
    background: #e8f4fd;
    padding: 15px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    margin: 10px 0;
}
```

### API Integration
The backend already provides all necessary data:
- `gameState.action_points`: Object mapping player_id to remaining AP
- `gameState.campaign_influences`: Array of campaign influences
- Campaign action endpoint: `POST /api/game/<id>/action` with `action_type: 'campaign'`

### Testing Requirements
1. **AP Display**: Verify AP are shown correctly for current player
2. **AP Validation**: Verify actions are disabled when insufficient AP
3. **Campaign Action**: Verify office selection and PC input work
4. **Turn Advancement**: Verify turn status updates correctly
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Verify UI works on mobile devices

### Files to Modify
- `static/script.js`: Main implementation
- `static/style.css`: Styling
- `static/index.html`: May need minor updates for new elements

### Success Criteria
- Players can see their remaining Action Points
- Action buttons show AP costs and are disabled when insufficient
- Campaign action works with office selection and PC input
- Turn status is clear and updates correctly
- UI is mobile responsive and user-friendly

## üéØ Immediate Development Priorities

1. **Frontend Implementation**: Complete the Action Points system UI (see Frontend Implementation Requirements section above)
2. **Extensive Playtesting**: Test the Action Points system and PC commitment systems thoroughly
3. **Balance Adjustments**: Fine-tune AP costs and PC commitment amounts based on playtesting
4. **Consider Network Action Design**: If Form Alliance is missed, implement the merged Network/Alliance system from `NETWORK_ACTION_DESIGN.md`
5. **Database Integration**: For production readiness
6. **Enhanced Testing**: More comprehensive unit tests for edge cases
7. **UI Polish**: Better visual feedback and animations

**The project is in excellent shape with a solid foundation, clear architecture, and comprehensive improvements. All major bugs have been fixed, new features are fully functional and tested, and the game is ready for extensive playtesting. The next LLM has a strong base to build upon with clear technical patterns and strategic direction established. The most immediate opportunity is completing the Action Points system frontend implementation and extensive playtesting of the new PC commitment and trading systems to ensure they enhance rather than detract from the game experience.**

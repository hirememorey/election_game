### Recent Critical Bug Fixes (LATEST)
- **Legislation Display Fix**: Fixed critical bug where pending legislation was showing as "undefined" in the final round of the term
  - **Issue**: Frontend was trying to access `legislation.title` and `legislation.description` directly from `PendingLegislation` objects, but these properties don't exist
  - **Root Cause**: `PendingLegislation` objects only contain `legislation_id`, `sponsor_id`, etc. The actual legislation data is in `gameState.legislation_options`
  - **Files Modified**: `static/script.js` - Fixed `updatePendingLegislationDisplay()`, `showVotingPhaseUI()`, `showLegislationSupportMenu()`, `showLegislationOpposeMenu()`, and `showTradeProposalMenu()`
  - **Impact**: Legislation now displays properly with titles, descriptions, and sponsor information instead of showing "undefined"
  - **Status**: Fixed and deployed

- **Trading Action Visibility Fix**: Fixed critical bug where trading actions weren't showing during legislation sessions

  - **Files Modified**: `static/script.js` - Updated phase name checks in action buttons, phase icons, and pending legislation display
  - **Impact**: Trading actions now properly appear during legislation sessions
  - **Status**: Fixed and deployed

- **Multiple Legislation Sponsorship Fix**: Fixed a bug that prevented players from sponsoring more than one piece of legislation per term. The system now correctly allows multiple bills to be sponsored and queued for the end-of-term legislation session.
  - **Issue**: The game engine was incorrectly blocking the sponsorship of a new bill if another one was already pending in the same turn.
  - **Files Modified**: `engine/resolvers.py`
  - **Impact**: Players can now sponsor multiple pieces of legislation in a single term, queuing them up for the end-of-term session as intended.
  - **Status**: Fixed and deployed

- **Impact**: Players now have a simpler action set: Fundraise, Network, Sponsor Legislation, Declare Candidacy, Use Favor, Support/Oppose Legislation, Trading, Campaign

### Previous Major Fixes
- **Legislation Session Timing:**  
  Legislation is now only resolved at the end of the term, during a dedicated legislation session phase. All sponsored bills are queued in `term_legislation` and resolved together after all players have had a chance to vote. Legislation is not resolved after each round. The frontend and backend are both confirmed to follow this logic.
  - `pending_legislation` is only for the current round, and is moved to `term_legislation` at upkeep.
  - See `test_legislation_timing.py` for a test that verifies this flow.

- **Support/Oppose Legislation Restrictions:**  
  Support and oppose legislation actions are now restricted to only the legislation session phase (end of term). Players cannot support or oppose legislation during rounds 1-3. This prevents premature legislation resolution and ensures all players have a chance to vote on bills during the dedicated session.

- **Frontend/Backend Sync:**  
  The UI and backend are now fully aligned on the legislation session mechanic. The frontend only displays voting options for unresolved legislation during the session, not after each round. Between rounds, queued legislation is not shown unless in the session.

- **Dependencies**: Minimal - just Flask and flask-cors (see requirements.txt)
- **Python Version**: Tested with Python 3.8+
- **Browser Testing**: Chrome/Firefox recommended for development

### Testing Strategy
- **Run all tests**: `python3 test_*.py` to verify everything works
- **Individual tests**: Each test file focuses on specific functionality
- **Manual testing**: Use the web interface for UI testing
- **Performance testing**: `performance_test.py` for response time verification

### Code Organization Patterns
- **Actions**: Add new actions in `engine/actions.py`, implement resolution in `engine/resolvers.py`
- **Game State**: Modify `models/game_state.py` for new state properties
- **Frontend**: Update `static/script.js` for UI logic, `static/style.css` for styling
- **API**: Add endpoints in `server.py`
- **Testing**: Create test files following existing patterns (see test_*.py files)

### Adding New Actions (Step-by-Step)
1. **Define Action Class** in `engine/actions.py`:
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class ActionNewAction(Action):
       # Add any parameters needed
       pass
   ```

2. **Implement Resolver** in `engine/resolvers.py`:
   ```python
   def resolve_new_action(state: GameState, action: ActionNewAction) -> GameState:
       # Implement game logic
       return state
   ```

3. **Register in Engine** in `engine/engine.py`:
   ```python
   self.action_resolvers = {
       # ... existing actions
       "ActionNewAction": resolvers.resolve_new_action,
   }
   ```

4. **Add API Endpoint** in `server.py`:
   ```python
   elif action_type == 'new_action':
       action = ActionNewAction(player_id=player_id)
   ```

5. **Add Frontend Button** in `static/script.js`:
   ```javascript
   { type: 'new_action', label: 'New Action', description: 'Description' }
   ```

6. **Test**: Create a test file following existing patterns

## üîß Technical Patterns to Follow

### Action System
- All game actions inherit from base `Action` class
- Actions are processed through `engine.process_action()`
- Resolution logic in `resolvers.py` maintains consistency
- Follow the pattern in `test_form_alliance_removal.py` for adding/removing actions

### State Management
- Game state is immutable (new state created for each action)
- Clear serialization for API communication
- State includes all necessary game information
- Term transitions properly clean up state

### Frontend-Backend Communication
- REST API with JSON payloads
- Frontend polls for state updates
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- PC commitment uses prompt dialogs for user input

### Mobile Responsiveness
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Responsive typography and spacing
- Favor selection menu is mobile-friendly

## üéÆ Game Balance Considerations

### Current Balance
- Political Capital (PC) is the primary resource
- Actions have clear costs and benefits
- Random events add unpredictability
- Favor system adds strategic depth
- **PC commitment system adds strategic depth**
- **Trading mechanic adds negotiation**
- **Action Points system adds player autonomy**
- **Simplified action set** (no Form Alliance) may need balance adjustments

### Potential Balance Issues
- PC commitment amounts may need tuning based on playtesting
- Trading mechanic may need balance adjustments
- Random events could be too swingy
- Player interaction could be enhanced
- **Missing Form Alliance** reduces strategic options - consider Network Action Design

## üö® Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **In-memory Storage**: Game state is lost on server restart (production needs database)
- **Single Session**: No persistent user accounts or game history
- **No AI Opponents**: All players must be human (or use CLI for testing)
- **Limited Analytics**: No game statistics or performance tracking
- **Missing Form Alliance**: Strategic depth reduced - consider Network Action Design
- **Trading Balance**: Trading mechanic may need balance adjustments based on playtesting
- **PC Commitment Balance**: PC commitment amounts may need tuning
- **Frontend Implementation**: Action Points UI needs completion (see `FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`)

### Potential Issues to Watch
- **Port Conflicts**: macOS AirPlay can block port 5000
- **Browser Compatibility**: Tested primarily on Chrome/Firefox
- **Mobile Performance**: Large game states may impact mobile devices
- **Concurrent Games**: Multiple simultaneous games may impact performance
- **Trading Complexity**: Trading phase may slow down legislation sessions
- **PC Commitment UX**: Prompt dialogs may need refinement

### Recent Bug Fixes
- **War Mood Lock**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Fixed bug where "War Breaks Out" event didn't properly lock public mood. Other events could still change public mood during war, violating the intended game mechanic. Now public mood is properly locked for the rest of the term when war is active.
- **Action Points System**: Backend fully implemented and tested
- **Use Favor Action**: Fixed to properly work with selection menu
- **PC Commitment**: Added custom PC amounts for legislation and candidacy
- **Automatic Event Phases**: Events now draw automatically
- **PEEK_EVENT Favor**: Now properly reveals top event card
- **Term Transitions**: Fixed state cleanup between terms
- **Legislation Timing**: Fixed premature legislation resolution
- **Support/Oppose Restrictions**: Now properly restricted to legislation session
- **Static File Serving**: Fixed 404 errors for CSS/JS files
- **Player Archetype Display**: Fixed missing archetype information in UI
- **Form Alliance Removal**: Successfully removed for simplified testing
- **Trading Implementation**: Successfully added trading mechanic with comprehensive testing

## üîÑ Re-enabling Form Alliance (If Needed)

If you want to re-enable the Form Alliance action:

1. **Restore Action Class** in `engine/actions.py`:
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class ActionFormAlliance(Action):
       pass
   ```

2. **Restore Resolver** in `engine/resolvers.py`:
   ```python
   def resolve_form_alliance(state: GameState, action: ActionFormAlliance) -> GameState:
       # Copy from git history or NETWORK_ACTION_DESIGN.md
   ```

3. **Update Imports** in all affected files
4. **Restore Frontend Button** in `static/script.js`
5. **Restore CLI Option** in `cli.py`
6. **Test**: Run `test_form_alliance_removal.py` to verify restoration

## üé® Frontend Implementation Requirements: Action Points System

### Overview
The Action Points system has been fully implemented in the backend but **requires frontend implementation**. This is a high-priority task that will complete Phase 2 of the game refinements.

### What Needs to Be Implemented

#### 1. Action Points Display
**Location**: `static/script.js` - `updateActionButtons()` function
**Requirements**:
- Show remaining Action Points for current player
- Display AP costs for each action button
- Disable actions when insufficient AP
- Clear visual indication of whose turn it is

**Implementation Pattern**:
```javascript
// Add to updateActionButtons()
const currentPlayer = gameState.players[gameState.current_player_index];
const remainingAP = gameState.action_points[currentPlayer.id] || 3;

// Show AP display
const apDisplay = document.createElement('div');
apDisplay.className = 'action-points-display';
apDisplay.innerHTML = `
    <strong>${currentPlayer.name}'s Turn</strong><br>
    Action Points: ${remainingAP}/3
`;
actionList.appendChild(apDisplay);

// Update action buttons with AP costs
const actions = [
    { type: 'fundraise', label: 'Fundraise', ap_cost: 1, description: 'Gain Political Capital' },
    { type: 'network', label: 'Network', ap_cost: 1, description: 'Gain PC and favors' },
    { type: 'sponsor_legislation', label: 'Sponsor Legislation', ap_cost: 2, description: 'Create legislation' },
    { type: 'campaign', label: 'Campaign', ap_cost: 2, description: 'Place influence for future election' },
    // ... other actions
];

// Disable actions when insufficient AP
const canAfford = remainingAP >= action.ap_cost;
button.disabled = !canAfford;
```

#### 2. Campaign Action UI
**Location**: `static/script.js` - Add new action button and handler
**Requirements**:
- Office selection dropdown (STATE_SENATOR, CONGRESS_SEAT, GOVERNOR, US_SENATOR, PRESIDENT)
- PC amount input field
- Validation (must have enough PC)
- Clear success/error feedback

**Implementation Pattern**:
```javascript
// Add to actions array
{ type: 'campaign', label: 'Campaign', ap_cost: 2, description: 'Place influence for future election' }

// Add campaign handler
function handleCampaignAction() {
    const officeSelect = document.getElementById('campaign-office');
    const pcInput = document.getElementById('campaign-pc');
    
    const officeId = officeSelect.value;
    const influenceAmount = parseInt(pcInput.value);
    
    if (!officeId || !influenceAmount || influenceAmount <= 0) {
        alert('Please select an office and enter a valid PC amount');
        return;
    }
    
    // Call API
    performAction('campaign', {
        office_id: officeId,
        influence_amount: influenceAmount
    });
}

// Add campaign modal/dialog
function showCampaignDialog() {
    const modal = document.createElement('div');
    modal.className = 'campaign-modal';
    modal.innerHTML = `
        <h3>Campaign for Office</h3>
        <select id="campaign-office">
            <option value="">Select Office...</option>
            <option value="STATE_SENATOR">State Senator</option>
            <option value="CONGRESS_SEAT">Congress Seat</option>
            <option value="GOVERNOR">Governor</option>
            <option value="US_SENATOR">US Senator</option>
            <option value="PRESIDENT">President</option>
        </select>
        <input type="number" id="campaign-pc" placeholder="PC to commit" min="1">
        <button onclick="handleCampaignAction()">Campaign</button>
        <button onclick="closeModal()">Cancel</button>
    `;
    document.body.appendChild(modal);
}
```

#### 3. Turn Status Display
**Location**: `static/script.js` - `updateGameState()` function
**Requirements**:
- Clear indication of current player
- Remaining AP display
- Turn phase information
- Visual feedback for turn transitions

**Implementation Pattern**:
```javascript
// Add to updateGameState()
const turnStatus = document.getElementById('turn-status');
const currentPlayer = gameState.players[gameState.current_player_index];
const remainingAP = gameState.action_points[currentPlayer.id] || 3;

turnStatus.innerHTML = `
    <div class="turn-info">
        <strong>Current Turn:</strong> ${currentPlayer.name}<br>
        <strong>Action Points:</strong> ${remainingAP}/3<br>
        <strong>Phase:</strong> ${gameState.current_phase}
    </div>
`;
```

#### 4. CSS Styling
**Location**: `static/style.css`
**Requirements**:
- Action points display styling
- Campaign modal styling
- Disabled action button styling
- Turn status styling
- Mobile responsive design

**Implementation Pattern**:
```css
.action-points-display {
    background: #f0f0f0;
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 10px 0;
    border-radius: 5px;
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: bold;
}

.campaign-modal {
    position: fixed;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    background: white;
    padding: 20px;
    border: 2px solid #333;
    border-radius: 10px;
    z-index: 1000;
}

.action-button:disabled {
    opacity: 0.5;
    cursor: not-allowed;
}

.turn-info {
    background: #e8f4fd;
    padding: 15px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    margin: 10px 0;
}
```

### API Integration
The backend already provides all necessary data:
- `gameState.action_points`: Object mapping player_id to remaining AP
- `gameState.campaign_influences`: Array of campaign influences
- Campaign action endpoint: `POST /api/game/<id>/action` with `action_type: 'campaign'`

### Testing Requirements
1. **AP Display**: Verify AP are shown correctly for current player
2. **AP Validation**: Verify actions are disabled when insufficient AP
3. **Campaign Action**: Verify office selection and PC input work
4. **Turn Advancement**: Verify turn status updates correctly
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Verify UI works on mobile devices

### Files to Modify
- `static/script.js`: Main implementation
- `static/style.css`: Styling
- `static/index.html`: May need minor updates for new elements

### Success Criteria
- Players can see their remaining Action Points
- Action buttons show AP costs and are disabled when insufficient
- Campaign action works with office selection and PC input
- Turn status is clear and updates correctly
- UI is mobile responsive and user-friendly

## üéØ Immediate Development Priorities

1. **Frontend Implementation**: Complete the Action Points system UI (see Frontend Implementation Requirements section above)
2. **Extensive Playtesting**: Test the Action Points system and PC commitment systems thoroughly
3. **Balance Adjustments**: Fine-tune AP costs and PC commitment amounts based on playtesting
4. **Consider Network Action Design**: If Form Alliance is missed, implement the merged Network/Alliance system from `NETWORK_ACTION_DESIGN.md`
5. **Database Integration**: For production readiness
6. **Enhanced Testing**: More comprehensive unit tests for edge cases
7. **UI Polish**: Better visual feedback and animations

## [2024-07-07] Negative Favors System
- The Political Favors system now includes negative favors, which can impose temporary or strategic disadvantages on players.
- The backend tracks and resolves all negative favor effects, including debts, public gaffes, media scrutiny, compromising positions, and hot potato.
- The frontend visually distinguishes negative favors and provides special UI for player choices and targeting.
- See GAME_IMPROVEMENTS.md for rationale and details.

#### Media Scrutiny Favor Logic Fix (2024-07-07)
- Media Scrutiny now halves only the base 5 PC from Fundraise actions. Bonuses (archetype, allies) are added after halving. This matches the intended design and ensures consistent, fair application of the effect.

### [2024-07-08] Bug Fix: Skip Trading Button in Legislation Session
- Fixed a frontend bug where clicking "Skip Trading" during the legislation session did nothing and logged `Unknown action type: complete_trading` in the console. The frontend now correctly triggers the `complete_trading` action, allowing the game to proceed to the voting phase as intended.

---

**The project is in excellent shape with a solid foundation, clear architecture, and comprehensive improvements. All major bugs have been fixed, new features are fully functional and tested, and the game is ready for extensive playtesting. The next LLM has a strong base to build upon with clear technical patterns and strategic direction established. The most immediate opportunity is completing the Action Points system frontend implementation and extensive playtesting of the new PC commitment and trading systems to ensure they enhance rather than detract from the game experience.**

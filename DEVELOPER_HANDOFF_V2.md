## Next Phase: Player-First Refactor

### Vision
Transform the game from a complex web application into a focused gameplay experience. The goal is to create a minimal interface that allows rapid testing and iteration of the core game mechanics.

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Command-Line Interface (Week 1)
**Goal**: Create the simplest possible interface for human vs AI gameplay

**Key Files to Create**:
- `cli_game.py` - Text-based game interface
- `human_vs_ai.py` - Game orchestration logic
- `gameplay_testing.py` - Testing and feedback framework

**Success Criteria**:
- Human can play complete game against AI
- Game state clearly displayed
- Actions easy to understand and execute

#### Phase 2: Minimal Web Interface (Week 2)
**Goal**: Web-deployed version with visual clarity but minimal complexity

**Key Files to Create**:
- `static/minimal.html` - Single-page interface
- `static/minimal.js` - Simplified game logic
- `static/minimal.css` - Clean, readable styling

**Success Criteria**:
- Interface loads and functions correctly
- Gameplay smooth and responsive
- Mobile-friendly design

#### Phase 3: Gameplay Iteration (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Use the minimal interface to test and refine gameplay

**Key Activities**:
- Play games with different AI opponents
- Identify and fix gameplay issues
- Measure engagement and balance
- Iterate rapidly on mechanics

### Technical Priorities

#### 1. Election Dice Roll Implementation
```python
# In engine/resolvers.py - already implemented for simulation
def resolve_elections(state: GameState, disable_dice_roll: bool = False) -> GameState:
    # Add dice roll logic for web version
    if not disable_dice_roll:
        for candidate in candidates:
            dice_roll = random.randint(1, 6)
            scores[candidate.name] += dice_roll
```

#### 2. CLI Game Interface
```python
# New file: cli_game.py
class CLIGame:
    def __init__(self, ai_persona: str = "heuristic"):
        self.harness = SimulationHarness()
        self.ai_persona = get_persona_class(ai_persona)()
    
    def display_game_state(self):
        # Show current state in text format
    
    def get_available_actions(self):
        # Return list of valid actions for human player
```

#### 3. Human vs AI Game Mode
```python
# New file: human_vs_ai.py
class HumanVsAIGame:
    def __init__(self, ai_persona: str = "heuristic"):
        self.cli_game = CLIGame(ai_persona)
    
    def play_game(self):
        # Main game loop
        while not game_over:
            if current_player == human:
                self.handle_human_turn()
            else:
                self.handle_ai_turn()
```

### Development Guidelines

#### 1. Start Simple
- Begin with command-line interface
- Focus on functionality over aesthetics
- Test frequently with actual gameplay

#### 2. Use Existing Infrastructure
- Leverage the robust simulation framework
- Reuse AI personas and game engine
- Maintain the statistical analysis capabilities

#### 3. Iterate Rapidly
- Make small, focused changes
- Test each change immediately
- Prioritize gameplay feel over features

#### 4. Focus on Core Experience
- Eliminate unnecessary complexity
- Ensure clear game state visibility
- Make actions easy to understand and execute

### Success Metrics

#### Phase 1 Metrics
- [ ] Human can play complete game against AI opponent
- [ ] Election dice rolls work in web version
- [ ] Game state is clearly displayed
- [ ] Actions are easy to understand and execute

#### Phase 2 Metrics
- [ ] Web interface loads and functions correctly
- [ ] Gameplay is smooth and responsive
- [ ] AI opponent selection works
- [ ] Interface is mobile-friendly

#### Phase 3 Metrics
- [ ] Gameplay feels engaging and balanced
- [ ] Win rates are reasonable (not too one-sided)
- [ ] Game length is appropriate (15-30 minutes)
- [ ] Players want to play again

### Risk Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
1. **Backend Complexity**: Keep changes minimal and focused
2. **Frontend Bugs**: Use simple, tested patterns
3. **Performance Issues**: Monitor game speed and responsiveness

#### Design Risks
1. **Interface Too Simple**: Balance clarity with functionality
2. **Gameplay Imbalance**: Use simulation data to guide adjustments
3. **User Engagement**: Focus on core gameplay loop

### Files to Create/Modify

#### New Files
- `cli_game.py` - Command-line game interface
- `human_vs_ai.py` - Human vs AI game orchestration
- `gameplay_testing.py` - Testing and feedback framework
- `static/minimal.html` - Minimal web interface
- `static/minimal.js` - Minimal web JavaScript
- `static/minimal.css` - Minimal web styling

#### Modified Files
- `cli.py` - Add election dice roll support
- `engine/resolvers.py` - Ensure dice rolls work in web version
- `simulation_harness.py` - Add human player support
- `models/game_state.py` - Add human player tracking

### Getting Started

1. **Read the Plan**: Review `PLAYER_FIRST_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` for detailed implementation steps
2. **Start with CLI**: Implement `cli_game.py` first for rapid testing
3. **Test Election Dice**: Ensure web version matches simulation behavior
4. **Build Human vs AI**: Create the core gameplay experience
5. **Iterate**: Use the minimal interface to refine gameplay

This handoff provides a clear roadmap for implementing the player-first refactor while leveraging the robust simulation framework we've built.

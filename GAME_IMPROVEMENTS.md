- Actions are processed through `engine.process_action()`
- Resolution logic in `resolvers.py` maintains consistency
- Follow the pattern in `test_form_alliance_removal.py` for adding/removing actions

### State Management
- Game state is immutable (new state created for each action)
- Clear serialization for API communication
- State includes all necessary game information
- Term transitions properly clean up state

### Frontend-Backend Communication
- REST API with JSON payloads
- Frontend polls for state updates
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- PC commitment uses prompt dialogs for user input

### Mobile Responsiveness
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Responsive typography and spacing
- Favor selection menu is mobile-friendly

## 🎮 Game Balance Considerations

### Current Balance
- Political Capital (PC) is the primary resource
- Actions have clear costs and benefits
- Random events add unpredictability

- **PC commitment system adds strategic depth**
- **Trading mechanic adds negotiation**
- **Action Points system adds player autonomy**

### Potential Balance Issues
- PC commitment amounts may need tuning based on playtesting

## [2024-07-07] Major Update: Negative Favors System

#### Media Scrutiny Fix (2024-07-07)
- The Media Scrutiny negative favor now halves only the base 5 PC from Fundraise actions. Any bonuses (such as archetype or ally bonuses) are added after halving the base amount. This ensures the effect is fair and consistent with the intended design.

### Overview
A new set of **negative Political Favors** has been added to the game to balance the Network action and introduce meaningful risk/reward. Players who Network now have a chance to draw negative favors, which introduce temporary or strategic disadvantages.

### New Negative Favors
- **Political Debt:** Owe a political debt to another player, who can force you to abstain or vote with them on legislation.
- **Public Gaffe:** Your next public action (Sponsor Legislation, Declare Candidacy, or Campaign) costs +1 AP.
- **Media Scrutiny:** All PC gained from Fundraise actions this round is halved.
- **Compromising Position:** Choose to discard two Political Favors or reveal your Archetype to all players.
- **Political Hot Potato:** Pass this to another player; whoever holds it at Upkeep loses 5 Influence.

### Rationale
- **Strategic Depth:** Players must now weigh the risk of drawing a negative favor when Networking, making Fundraising a more attractive and safe alternative in some situations.
- **Player Interaction:** Negative favors often involve other players, increasing negotiation, leverage, and emergent diplomacy.
- **Game Balance:** The Network action is no longer strictly superior to Fundraising, and the overall favor economy is more dynamic.

### Implementation Notes
- All negative favors are fully integrated in both backend and frontend.
- The UI visually distinguishes negative favors and provides special handling for choices (e.g., Compromising Position).
- Comprehensive tests confirm the new system works as intended.

## [2024-07-08] Bug Fix: Skip Trading Button in Legislation Session

- Fixed a frontend bug where clicking "Skip Trading" during the legislation session did nothing and logged `Unknown action type: complete_trading` in the console.
- The frontend now correctly triggers the `complete_trading` action, allowing the game to proceed to the voting phase as intended.

- State includes all necessary game information
- Term transitions properly clean up state

### Frontend-Backend Communication
- REST API with JSON payloads
- Frontend polls for state updates
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- PC commitment uses prompt dialogs for user input

### Mobile Responsiveness
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Responsive typography and spacing
- Favor selection menu is mobile-friendly

## 🎮 Game Balance Considerations

### Current Balance
- Political Capital (PC) is the primary resource
- Actions have clear costs and benefits
- Random events add unpredictability
- Favor system adds strategic depth
- **PC commitment system adds strategic depth**

# Mobile Improvements Summary

## [2025-01-27] Modal Close Button Fix (NEW)
- **Problem:** The "View Identity" modal close button (×) was not visible or clickable, making it impossible to exit the modal on both desktop and mobile.
- **Solution:** Fixed pointer events and z-index issues to ensure the close button is always visible and clickable.
- **Implementation:**
  - Added sticky positioning and higher z-index to `.modal-header` and `.close-btn`
  - Set `pointer-events: none` on modal content (`.identity-section`, `.identity-card`) to prevent interference
  - Set `pointer-events: auto` on `.modal-header` and `.close-btn` to ensure they remain clickable
  - Added box-shadow and background to modal header for better visibility
  - Added padding-top to modal content to prevent content from covering the sticky header
- **Testing:** Created and ran Playwright test to verify close button visibility and clickability across all browsers
- **Impact:**
  - Close button is now always visible and clickable on all devices
  - Modal can be properly closed on both desktop and mobile
  - Improved user experience for identity modal access

## [2025-07-15] Event Log Collapse with 'More' Button (NEW)
- **Problem:** Event log was covering or pushing down action buttons on mobile, making actions hard to access.
- **Solution:** Event log now displays only the latest entry as a single line, with a 'More' button to view the full log in a modal.
- **Implementation:**
  - Updated `static/script.js` to show only the latest log entry and a 'More' button.
  - Added `showFullGameLog()` to display all log entries in a modal using the existing modal system.
  - Updated `static/style.css` to style the single-line log and 'More' button for mobile.
- **Impact:**
  - Action buttons are always visible and accessible on mobile.
  - Players can still access the full event log at any time via the 'More' button.
  - Dramatically improves mobile usability and declutters the main game screen.

## [2025-07-15] Modal Accessibility Fix for Mobile (NEW)
- **Problem:** On mobile, the submit button for supporting/opposing legislation was not visible or accessible in the modal.
- **Solution:** Modal content is now scrollable and action buttons are always visible, even on small screens.
- **Implementation:**
  - Updated `.modal-content` and `.modal-actions` styles in `static/style.css` to ensure the modal fits the viewport and buttons are accessible.
- **Impact:**
  - Players can always submit their support/opposition on mobile, improving game flow and usability.

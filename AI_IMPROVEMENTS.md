# AI Behavior Improvements

## Recent Enhancements

### Smart Game Effect Awareness

The AI opponents have been enhanced to be aware of game effects and make smarter decisions:

#### Stock Market Crash Awareness
- **Problem**: AI players were choosing to Fundraise during stock market crashes, which costs them 5 PC instead of gaining PC
- **Solution**: All AI personas now check for the "STOCK_CRASH" effect before choosing Fundraise actions
- **Implementation**: Modified `choose_action` methods in all persona classes to filter out Fundraise actions when stock crash is active

#### Files Modified
- `personas/economic_persona.py`
- `personas/heuristic_persona.py`
- `personas/balanced_persona.py`
- `personas/legislative_persona.py`

### Improved CLI Turn Display

#### Better Action Visibility
- **Problem**: CLI was only showing the last action from each AI turn, missing multiple actions
- **Solution**: Modified CLI to show all actions taken during an AI's turn
- **Implementation**: Updated `CLIMultiAIGame` class to display all turn log messages from the current AI's turn

#### Enhanced User Experience
- Added pause between AI turns for better game flow
- Improved action descriptions and logging
- Better separation between different AI players' actions

### Full Action Point Utilization

#### Complete AP Usage
- **Problem**: AI players sometimes didn't use all their Action Points before passing
- **Solution**: Modified AI turn processing to loop until all AP are exhausted
- **Implementation**: Updated `process_ai_turn` methods in `human_vs_ai.py`

#### Profitable Action Preference
- **Problem**: AI would pass even when profitable actions (like Fundraise) were available
- **Solution**: Modified persona logic to filter out Pass Turn when other actions are available
- **Implementation**: Updated all persona classes to prioritize profitable actions over passing

## Technical Details

### Stock Market Crash Detection
```python
# Check for stock market crash - avoid Fundraise during crash
stock_crash_active = "STOCK_CRASH" in game_state.active_effects

# Filter out Pass Turn and Fundraise (if stock crash is active)
profitable_actions = []
for action in valid_actions:
    if isinstance(action, ActionPassTurn):
        continue
    if isinstance(action, ActionFundraise) and stock_crash_active:
        continue  # Skip Fundraise during stock crash
    profitable_actions.append(action)
```

### Turn Log Tracking
```python
# Process AI turn
self.game.process_ai_turn()

# Display what the AI did
if self.game.state and self.game.state.turn_log:
    # Show only the messages from this AI's turn
    print(f"\n{current_player}'s actions:")
    # Since the turn log is cleared before each action, we need to show all current messages
    # as they should all be from this AI's turn
    for message in self.game.state.turn_log:
        if message.strip():  # Only show non-empty messages
            print(f"  {message}")
```

## Testing

### Verification Steps
1. Run `python3 cli_game.py multi` to test against 3 AI opponents
2. Observe that AI players avoid Fundraise during stock market crashes
3. Verify that all AI actions are displayed in the CLI
4. Confirm that AI players use all their Action Points before passing

### Expected Behavior
- AI players should never choose Fundraise when "STOCK_CRASH" is in `game_state.active_effects`
- CLI should show all actions taken by each AI player during their turn
- AI players should use all available Action Points before passing their turn
- Human player should see detailed action logs for each AI turn

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
- Add awareness of other game effects (media scrutiny, public gaffe, etc.)
- Implement more sophisticated decision-making based on game state
- Add personality-based action preferences
- Improve AI strategic planning across multiple turns

### Code Quality
- Add unit tests for AI behavior improvements
- Document AI decision-making logic more thoroughly
- Consider adding AI difficulty levels
- Implement AI learning from game outcomes
